As of mid-March, a number of important events have unfolded recently. I have just returned from the 
FOSSASIA Summit 2025, a notable technology conference held over four days in Thailand. I attended the event with two friends, 
TÃº and Xiaoming, and am now taking some time to rest and reflect on the experience.

TÃº is a university friend and colleague at Viettel Group, while Xiaoming is a friend and contributor to the Kusion project, 
currently employed at Ant Group. Despite having had numerous online discussions, this meeting marked our first face-to-face interaction. 
During this meeting, I discovered that Xiaoming is five years older than me.

The recent trip to Thailand was both enjoyable and somewhat exhausting due to the hot weather. During the event, Xiaoming and 
I presented a talk focused on "[Optimizing the Software Development Process with IDP and Kusion](https://eventyay.com/e/4c0e0c27/session/9434)", 
which generated significant interest and prompted numerous questions regarding our open-source product. This marked my second time attending FOSSASIA as a Speaker. 
This year's event took place at **The True Digital Park**, which is larger compared to last year's venue in Vietnam, yet still 
attracted a high number of attendees. FOSSASIA continues to be a remarkable platform for technology and open-source discussions, 
and I am enthusiastic about sharing the product I have contributed to with the community. The meeting was scheduled for one day only, 
as Xiaoming had to leave early due to an unexpected work obligation.

I felt a tinge of sadness that my girlfriend couldn't join me this time, but we still created so many beautiful memories together. 
As a surprise, I decided to buy her a delightful set of figurines called LABUBU, which I knew she adored. Theyâ€™re simply enchanting 
little animal models, each full of personality and charm. The excitement of unboxing them was already palpable, especially because thereâ€™s a 
secret character that she loves, and the odds of finding it are quite rare. To my amazement, when I opened the very first box out of six, 
there it was the secret character! Her face lit up with pure joy, and in that moment, every bit of longing I felt for her absence faded away. 
It was a small yet magical moment that reminded me how much I love making her happy. ðŸ¥°

We had an amazing time hanging out together! I took her to some really cool spots in Thailand, like the lively Khaosan Road (the ultimate food street), 
vibrant Siam Square, and the stunning Grand Palace. We even cycled all around Bangkok, which was such a fun adventure! I indulged in so much delicious 
Thai food, but wow, it was spicy! It definitely took me a few days to recover from all that yumminess (sorry for the overshare, everyone! ðŸ˜Š).

After coming back to Vietnam, I jumped right in to help my girlfriend with her exciting new project â€“ a retail store! 
I've been lending a hand with the tech side of things by building her website. Itâ€™s amazing how quickly everything is coming 
together, even just a few days in! Sheâ€™s been busy surveying and tackling the paperwork for trademark and company registration. 
We even got the first version of the website up and running, featuring an adorable rabbit holding a jackfruit. Isnâ€™t that super cute?

Iâ€™m really excited about the upcoming plan to showcase a bunch of fun products on sites like Amazon, Etsy, 
and our very own online store! Thereâ€™s still some work to do, but everything is going smoothly so far, and 
Iâ€™m hopeful that the project will turn out just as she envisions. Itâ€™s called **HeppyFly**, and Iâ€™d love for you to check it out and show your support! ðŸ˜‡

Another bit of good news! Just before heading to the FOSSASIA event, I received my acceptance notification for the Master's program 
at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) along with the ECE Pioneering Competitive Scholarship! Iâ€™m super happy about this, especially since 
I only applied to UTSA and didnâ€™t apply for scholarships thinking I could only do that after officially enrolling. What a nice surprise!

I am resolutely pursuing my Master's degree in the US, and recently, I made a significant decision that reflects my commitment that 
I resigned from my position at Viettel Group prior to receiving an admission and scholarship offer from one of the universities I applied to. 
While some might view this as a rash move or a sign of being unprepared, I see it as a strategic step toward a future I've been eagerly working toward.

For me, this wasn't just a whim, it was a carefully considered choice fueled by my passion for furthering my education and expanding my horizons. 
I have always believed that true progress often requires taking risks, and in this case, Iâ€™m confident that I made the right one. 

I am fully dedicated to achieving my goals, and I know that my hard work and perseverance will pay off. I genuinely believe that when you 
invest time and energy into your aspirations, the universe has a way of aligning in your favor. Itâ€™s essential to trust in your unique journey 
and remain focused on your vision. Along the way, itâ€™s important to continually reflect on whether youâ€™ve truly given it your all and if your 
efforts are worthy of the outcomes you seek.

This journey is far from over and itâ€™s not just about my experiences. Embrace the challenges and opportunities that life presents, 
and remember that success often favors those who are brave enough to take bold steps forward. I wish that this message helps you discover 
your own path within this story. Stay focused and believe in yourselves you have the power to shape the future you desire. 
I wish each of you the best of luck and immense success in all your future endeavors!

Wishing everyone great success with their endeavors and a wonderful future ahead! ðŸš€

From @hoangndst with love ðŸ¤“.
